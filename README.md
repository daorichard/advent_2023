# Advent of Code 2023

The purpose of this repo is to practice coding during the holiday season. I will be achieving this through the advent of Code.

I will be using python / javascript to solve these problems.

# Things I learned from each day

- Day 1: enumerate in python to create an object with indexes given an array
- Day 2: Refresher on map, reduce, filter, and every methods in js
